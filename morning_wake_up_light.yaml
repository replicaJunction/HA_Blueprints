    My take on a gradual wake-up light automation that provides a sort of "sunrise" effect. The target time should be provided as an [input date/time helper](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_datetime/), though only the time properties are used for this automation.

    The time in this helper is when the automation will **complete**, to make it easier to synchronize it with some other time (like a morning alarm). The automation will actually begin before the time set in this helper in order to make sure the lights are all the way on when the time is reached.

    Optionally, "prefix" or "suffix" actions can also be specified to act at the beginning or at the end of the automation.'
